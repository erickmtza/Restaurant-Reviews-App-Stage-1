# Mobile Web Specialist Certification Course

#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 1

The objective is to convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. Starting with the CSS, modifications were made to be more responsive for users on mobile devices, then enhancements were made to the page's HTML for improved accessibility. A service worker was added to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

### Running the Project

Once the projects files have been obtained by either clone or zip and stored on local drive:
1. Within the root of the repository, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files using the following instructions:

* In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
